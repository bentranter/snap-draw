# SnapDraw

A drawing app with Snap.svg and Backbone.js.

### Running

You'll need WebPack and the Webpack dev server:

```bash
$ npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server
```

To run it, just

```bash
$ npm install && npm start
```

Then open your browser to `0.0.0.0:8080`.

### Usage

TBD.

### What Works So Far?

In Chrome, panning works with the scroll wheel on your mouse, or better yet, the trackpad. Zooming in and out is also simulated by modifying the viewBox height and width. Drawing is ok, but doesn't work properly when zoomed in or out.
